# Serverless Architecture Basics
**Definition/Overview:** Infrastructure management is a unique DevOps challenge (and necessary goal) for Cloud-based enterprises. *Serverless architecture* helps make meeting that goal happen by assisting DevOps teams with resource provisioning, app testing and execution, building and deployment of apps, service automation and delivery, algorithmic cost-efficiency, and server maintenance and scalability. All of these features are provided via code functions defined by development teams, as well as the provisioning of abstract and dynamic server management controls.
